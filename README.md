CSV Source for Écoute
=====================

This will be a Source for reading data stored in a Comma-separated values-file, abbreviated CSV, into an [Écoute][ecoute-core]-instance.

[ecoute-core]: https://github.com/gausby/ecoute

It is under development, and is not really usable at the moment.


## Usage

### Configuration



## Development
After cloning the project you will have to run `npm install` in the project root. This will install the various grunt plugins and other dependencies.


### QA tools
The QA tools rely on the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) task runner. To run any of these tools, you will need the grunt-cli installed globally on your system. This is easily done by typing the following in a terminal.

    $ npm install grunt-cli -g

The unit tests will need the [Buster](http://busterjs.org/) unit test framework.

    $ npm install -g buster

These two commands will install the buster and grunt commands on your system. These can be removed by typing `npm uninstall buster -g` and `npm uninstall grunt-cli -g`.


#### Unit Tests
When developing you want to run the script watcher. Navigate to the project root and type the following in your terminal.

    $ grunt watch:scripts

This will run the jshint and tests each time a file has been modified.


#### Documentation
The project uses YUIDocs that can be generated by running `grunt docs`. This will create a site with documentation in a folder called `docs/` in the project root which can be served on port 8888 by typing `grunt connect:docs`. If you want to generate docs on file modification you can run `grunt watch:docs`.
